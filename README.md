# Bang Simulation

This repository contains a simple simulation of the board game **Bang!**. It uses
Python and `pandas` to run multiple games and gather statistics about the
outcome.

## Installation

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the simulation using:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will prompt for the number of players and optionally which
characters to use.
